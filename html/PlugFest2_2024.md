# ADM-OSC PlugFest #2

## 7 October 2024

Spatial & immersive audio has become mainstream, both in concert halls and through music streaming services. A diverse ecosystem of hardware and software controllers and renderers in both live and studio settings could benefit from a standardized communication protocol. Since 2021 a growing group of industry stakeholders has been developing ADM-OSC to fill this need.

**ADM-OSC** is a standard for transmitting position data for object-based audio by implementing a namespace in parallel with the Audio Definition Model (ADM), a metadata standard developed in the broadcast industry. Open Sound Control (OSC) is a well-established data transport protocol developed for communication of real-time performance data. By leveraging these open standards, we have created a lightweight specification that can be easily implemented in audio software, plugins, game engines, consoles, and controllers.
