## An OSC dictionary that implements the Audio Definition Model (ADM)<

Spatial and immersive audio has become increasingly mainstream, presented in concert halls and more recently through music streaming services. There is a diverse ecosystem of hardware and software controllers and renderers in both live and studio settings that would benefit from a standardized communication protocol. 
                
Since 2021 a growing group of industry stakeholders has been working to develop ADM-OSC to fill this need. ADM-OSC proposes a standard for transmitting position data for object-based audio (OBA) by implementing a namespace in parallel with the Audio Definition Model (ADM), a metadata standard developed in the broadcast industry. Open Sound Control (OSC) is a well-established data transport protocol developed for flexible and accurate communication of real-time performance data.  

By leveraging these open standards, we have created a lightweight specification that can be easily implemented in audio software, plugins, game engines, consoles, and controllers.
