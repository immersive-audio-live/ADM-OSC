    # This field adds keywords for your project which will appear on the
    # project page. What does your project relate to?
    #
    # Note that this is a list of additional keywords, separated
    # by commas, to be used to assist searching for the distribution in a
    # larger catalog.

    # When your source code is in a subdirectory under the project root, e.g.
    # `src/`, it is necessary to specify the `package_dir` argument.
    package_dir={'': 'Source'},  # Optional

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    packages=find_packages(where='Source'),  # Required

    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
    # 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this
    # and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. See
    # https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires
    python_requires='>=3.6, <4',

    # This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
    # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
    # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.
    #
    # For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's requirements files see:
    # https://packaging.python.org/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements/
    install_requires=['peppercorn', 'python-osc'],  # Optional

    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # dependencies). Users will be able to install these using the "extras"
    # syntax, for example:
    #
    #   $ pip install adm_osc[dev]
    #
    # Similar to `install_requires` above, these must be valid existing
    # projects.
    extras_require={  # Optional

    # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # installed, specify them here.
    #package_data={  # Optional
    #    'sample': ['package_data.dat'],
    #},

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files
    #
    # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'
    #data_files=[('my_data', ['data/data_file'])],  # Optional

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    #entry_points={  # Optional
    #    'console_scripts': [
    #        'sample=sample:main',
    #    ],
    #},

    # List additional URLs that are relevant to your project as a dict.

    # This field corresponds to the "Project-URL" metadata fields:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#project-url-multiple-use
    #
    # Examples listed include a pattern for specifying where the package tracks
    # issues, where the source is hosted, where to say thanks to the package
    # maintainers, and where to support the project financially. The key is
    # what's used to render the link text on PyPI.
