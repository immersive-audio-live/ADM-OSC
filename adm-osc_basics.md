# ADM-OSC principals

## Coordinates

### Sender (client)
- Object Editor sending positioning data to one or more receivers.
- Position data is always normalized
### Receiver (server)
- Handles the (optional) local scaling of normalized data: x, y, z, distance
- The receiver can be a DAW, an ADM renderer, an object editor, a bridge (ADM-OSC <-> sADM)
